| **6** | Sync data to Google Shared Drive (separate private vs shared data entries) | **100% Complete** ✅ | • `isShared: Boolean` on all entities<br>• `SyncRepository.kt` (Exports only `isShared == true` records; private records stay local)<br>• Two-way delta merge with Last-Write-Wins (LWW) conflict resolution<br>• `GoogleDriveSyncClient.kt` (Dual-mode Google Sign-In + Drive REST API client)<br>• `PalateLog_Family` folder and `Photos/` subfolder in Google Drive<br>• WorkManager background sync (`SyncWorker.kt`) |
| **7** | Store pictures along with entries (optionally shown when viewing details) | **100% Complete** ✅ | • Multi-photo support (`photoUris: List<String>` in `DishFeedbackEntity`, `photoUris` / `billReceiptPhotoUri` in `VisitEntryEntity`)<br>• System Gallery (`GetContent("image/*")`) & Camera (`TakePicture`) integration<br>• Internal storage persistence via `MediaUtils.copyUriToInternalStorage()`<br>• Coil `AsyncImage` gallery rendering & `FullscreenPhotoDialog` preview<br>• Automatic 2-way Google Drive family photo sync |
| **8** | Optionally store bill, price details | **100% Complete** ✅ | • `billAmount: Double` in `VisitEntryEntity`<br>• `price: Double` in `DishFeedbackEntity`<br>• Bill amount input in `EntryEditorScreen`<br>• Bill amount display in `VisitHistoryCard` (`RestaurantDetailScreen`) |
| **9** | Store multiple visits to same restaurant for aggregated metrics | **100% Complete** ✅ | • `RestaurantEntity` 1-to-many `VisitEntryEntity`<br>• Total visits counter on `RestaurantCard`<br>• Visit history timeline on `RestaurantDetailScreen`<br>• Aggregated Dish Matrix showing cumulative verdicts across multiple visits |
| **10** | Work offline (without internet access), two-way sync periodically or by user trigger | **100% Complete** ✅ | • 100% offline-first architecture via local Room SQLite DB<br>• `SyncWorker` (WorkManager periodic background sync)<br>• "Sync Now" button in `SettingsScreen`<br>• OpenStreetMap offline tile caching |
| **UI 1** | Minimalist UI during data entry & pre-filling | **100% Complete** ✅ | • **3-Second Quick Regret Logger**: 1-tap GPS, 1-tap NO-GO verdict, quick tag chips ("Watery tea", "Soggy food", "Dirty restrooms"). Saves in 3s.<br>• **Pre-filling**: Selecting an existing restaurant in `EntryEditorScreen` auto-populates past dishes as instant selectable chips with past verdicts! |
| **UI 2** | Map View with custom markers & navigation | **100% Complete** ✅ | • Interactive OpenStreetMap (OSMDroid) with custom color-coded pins (🟢 Go, 🔴 No-Go, 🟡 Caution)<br>• Bottom sheet drawer on pin tap with "Navigate in Google Maps" handoff |

## 2. Prioritized Roadmap & Completed Milestones

Based on the gap analysis, here are the completed phases and recommended next steps in order of priority:

### Phase 2A: UX Polish & Enhanced Querying (Completed ✅)
1. **Dish-Aware Unified Search (Completed ✅)**:
   - Tokenized search across restaurant metadata and dish names, ranking exact dish matches at top with matched dish chips on `RestaurantCard`.
2. **Camera & PhotoPicker Integration (Completed ✅)**:
   - 1-tap gallery and camera photo attachments for bill receipts and dish photos with internal storage persistence, thumbnail galleries, fullscreen viewer, and 2-way Google Drive photo sync.

### Phase 2B: Google Drive Direct Cloud Sync (Completed ✅)
3. **Dual-Mode Family Google Drive Sync (Completed ✅)**:
   - Single Shared Account (Mode A) and Individual Accounts with automated in-app invitations (Mode B).
   - Static QR code / WhatsApp link sharing (`palatelog://sync?folderId=<folderId>`).

### Phase 2C: Code Hygiene, Design System & In-App Updates (Completed ✅)
4. **In-App Google Play Updates (Completed ✅)**:
   - Flexible updates, background progress tracking, loop-safe `onResume` status checks, and explicit restart prompt dialogs (`InAppUpdateHelper`).
5. **Design System Tokens & Non-Transitive R (`Dimens.kt`) (Completed ✅)**:
   - Created `Dimens.kt` for spacing, corner radii, icon sizes, and button heights.
   - Enabled `android.nonTransitiveRClass=true` in `gradle.properties`.

### Phase 2D: User Onboarding, Localization & Navigation Polish (Completed ✅)
6. **Interactive Help & User Guide (`HelpGuideScreen`) (Completed ✅)**:
   - Material 3 user guidebook with category filter chips, onboarding welcome dialog, and type-safe `HelpTopicKey` deep-linking shortcuts across screens (`?` buttons).
7. **Comprehensive UI Localization & Hardcoded String Extraction (Completed ✅)**:
   - Extracted 80+ hardcoded Compose UI strings into `res/values/strings.xml` for internationalization (i18n) and TalkBack accessibility.
8. **Dark Theme High-Contrast Polish & Layout Fixes (Completed ✅)**:
   - Fixed text contrast in Dark Theme tip callouts and eliminated awkward button text wrapping ("Navigate") in map preview cards.
9. **Content-Aware Floating Scroll Indicators (Completed ✅)**:
   - Auto-fading circular down-arrow indicators on Explore and Restaurant Detail screens with 1-tap scroll down and bottom navigation bar inset protection.

### Phase 3: Advanced Travel Features (Upcoming)
10. **Highway Route Corridor Search**:
    - Allow entering an Origin and Destination (e.g. Bangalore to Chennai) to query all logged stops within 5-10 km along that highway corridor.
11. **Proximity Regret Warning Notification (Optional Geofence)**:
    - When driving within 200m of a restaurant previously marked **NO-GO 🔴**, pop up a friendly reminder: *"Heads up! You marked [Highway Tea Stall] as NO-GO (Terrible watery tea) on May 2024."*
